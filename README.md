# Minesweeper
Minesweeper is an oldschool game that dates back to the earliest mainframe games of the 1960s and 1970s. The player is presented with a field of cells, some of which contain hidden mines. You can open any of the closed cells and find out how many mines are around it, or stumble upon a mine right there and lose. Your goal is to open all the empty cells and flag all the cells with mines.

You'll learn the basics of React and be able to create almost any web application depending on your knowledge of JavaScript. While working through the stages, you will also strengthen your skills in HTML and CSS.
